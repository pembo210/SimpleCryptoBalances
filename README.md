SimpleCryptoBalances
====================

Get all your BTC/LTC/DOGE balances quickly without a browser. 

Simply add all your Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin addresses to a text file (addr.txt) with BTC/LTC/DOGE on a line then the address on the next. See example addr.txt file format. The addresses are demo addresses selected from a p2pool from each coin. The script retrieves balances from the Blockchain.info, Explorer.litecoin.net, Dogechain API and then displays the results.
